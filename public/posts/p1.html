        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"We need more stability in the environments, bugs are getting into higher environments that shouldn't..."
            </p>
            <p>"Well we haven't got around to happy path automation...we have the QA suite but the QA guys are checking
                more
                so that the features are "done" to spec than a focus on stability and regressions."</p>
            <p>"Ye..we have asked about setting up Cypress in pipelines to DevOps several times but nothing seems to have
                materialise...maybe more unit tests?"</p>
            <p>"We have plenty - and as you said, bugs are still moving upwards more often than not, stuff we should be
                catching not
                long after it leaves a developers machine"</p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>There is plenty to unpack from the above conversation...which we won't be doing :)</p>
        <p>So keeping at face value, the "ideal way" an engineer might think of would be for our end-to-end (Cypress)
            suite to be always running
            in our pipelines during deploys, maybe even additionaly in their own pipeline.
            Always running, and pinging us when failures occurs. Running a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_browser">headless browser</a> in pipelines at any "enterprise" capacity might make business owners wince.</p>
        </p>
        <p>But business as usual - new products or features are made, deadlines are always tight, blind spots appear and
            maybe not the most
            productive patterns start appearing. Some are addressed, others linger on.
            <br />Same old, same old.
        </p>

        <p>So by the end of the conversation, I decide "ideal" isn't happening...now I've waited long enough, in fact,
            this waiting has probably caused everyone to be worse off.</p>
        <p>What I ended up doing was writing a small-ish Cypress <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path">"happy path"</a> test and then an additional bash script to
            run that Cypress test indefinitely and print out some stats - fails, passes, avg runtime, time test
            finished...</p>
        <p>Each run takes around 20 seconds.</p>
        <p>E2E tests are notoriously flaky, which is why its better to keep them running until failures are continuous.
        </p>
        <p>10 fails in a row should be enough to think - "ok, something could be broken.", so let's also make the laptop
            make a noise if/when we have 10 failures in a row. Additionally anything with the word "Error" in it, Cypress prints out will get shoved into a log file if I need to check some common failures or even tally them up.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Here is a version of the bash script:</p>
        <pre class="codeBlock">
echo "Starting Happy Path Watcher...."
NOTIFICATION_FAILURE_LIMIT=10

    fi
    echo -e "$(date) - failed...\033[0m"
    if [ $consecutive_fail_count -ge $NOTIFICATION_FAILURE_LIMIT ]; then
        send_notification
    fi
    fi
    END_RUN_TIME=$(date +%s)

    # Calculate the running time of just one run.
    RUN_TIME_OF_ONE_PASS=$((END_RUN_TIME - START_RUN_TIME))
    total_time=$((total_time + RUN_TIME_OF_ONE_PASS))
    average_time=$((total_time / (pass_count + fail_count)))

    # Calculate scripts running time.
    END_TIME=$(date +%s)

        <p>Yep, pretty ugly, I usually run it at the start of my work day if it isn't already running.
             I might even get 2 other laptops and point them at our other environments.</p>
        <p>"But but, what about maintainability, do they only work for you?, what about when you aren't here?, why did you use bash!?" - All valid concerns....
            after a few days I had caught several issues within a few minutes of anyones deployments.</p>
        <p>It's common for developers to be doing something when a collegue or manager points out the "ideal way"
            to do whatever you were doing. Either to have the converstaion with the appropriate person/team or wait
            until something that is "suppose" to happen,
            happens because "o ye (some dev) is doing that, I think they are going to sort it out soon."
            In fact you probably get this almost every single day in various forms, code reviews, standups, meetings etc.
        </p>
        </p>
        <p>How well you make this call and can factor into the companies success or your own, sometimes at the cost of
            each other.</p>
